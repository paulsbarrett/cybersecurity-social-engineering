## Social Engineering Observations

### The Water Cooler Topics

When asked to test company cybersecurity weaknesses (penetration testing), we found that we could gather intel via social engineering techniques, and from the information gathered, formulate password and username lists.

When studying the target, we would listen and observe to the immediate discussion at hand. These 'water cooler' discussions disclose an aweful lot of what is important to an individual.

Once we have added a hot topic, high value password resource, we added the key word to [https://www.dcode.fr/password-variation](https://www.dcode.fr/password-variation) and then added the results to our own 'password.txt' lists.

### The Path of Least Resistance

Humans are social animals, and they more often than not, take shortcuts to achieve an outcome; these shortcuts also extend to password selection. The delusion is that the target may think they are being clever, or because they have a password that other people probably wouldn't be using. A brute force attack by a computer without social engineering would take approximately 8 hours to crack the 8 character password 'R0x3tt3!' according to [https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/). That time is reduced to mere seconds if you are using an unsecured Wi-Fi network. But a hacker cannot rely on a target's device being connected to an unsecured network - this is where social engineering pays off.

The reason it works is because people will more often than not, use the path of least resistance when it comes to storing sensitive data, and unbelievably, when it comes to chosing a password. The thinking here is, "how will I easily remember it"?
