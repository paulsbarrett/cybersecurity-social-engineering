## Social Engineering Observations
When asked to test company cybersecurity weaknesses (penetration testing), we found that we could gather intel via social engineering techniques, and from the information gathered, formulate password and username lists.

When studying the target, we would listen and observe to the immediate discussion at hand. These 'water cooler' disclose an aweful lot of what is important to an individual.

Once we have added a hot topic, high value password resource, we added the key word to [https://www.dcode.fr/password-variation](https://www.dcode.fr/password-variation) and then added the results to our own 'password.txt' lists.
