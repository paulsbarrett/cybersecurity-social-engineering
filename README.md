## Social Engineering Observations

### The Water Cooler Topics

When asked to test company cybersecurity weaknesses (penetration testing), we found that we could gather intel via social engineering techniques, and from the information gathered, formulate password and username lists.

When studying the target, we would listen and observe to the immediate discussion at hand. These 'water cooler' discussions disclose an aweful lot of what is important to an individual.

Once we have added a hot topic, high value password resource, we added the key word to [https://www.dcode.fr/password-variation](https://www.dcode.fr/password-variation) and then added the results to our own 'password.txt' lists.

### The Path of Least Resistance

Humans are social animals, and they more often than not, take shortcuts to achieve an outcome; these shortcuts also extend to password selection. The delusion is that the target may think they are being clever, or because they have selected a password that they assume other people probably wouldn't be using. A brute force attack by a computer without social engineering would take approximately 8 hours to crack the 8 character password 'R0x3tt3!' according to [https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/). That time is reduced to mere seconds if you are using an unsecured Wi-Fi network. But a hacker cannot rely on a target's device being connected to an unsecured network - this is where social engineering pays off. The target was discussing the death of Roxette's lead singer Marie Fredriksson, what concerts they had attended, and that they owned every single album; this was a huge lead to suggest what was a big influence in this target's life.

The reason it works is because people will more often than not, use the path of least resistance when it comes to storing sensitive data, and unbelievably, when it comes to chosing a password. The thinking here is, "how will I **easily** remember it"?


### You are what you eat

The passwords of men were much more predictable when it came to topics such as sporting teams or sexual references. Observing what was repeatedly discussed, looked forward to, or that the discussion kept returning to, gave a strong suggestion as to what the target's password also related to. We found passwords were also socially and geographically influenced: for example, males originally English born now living in Australia that were extremely sport focused had passwords relating to the sport they followed - Cricket had passwords relating to "england lions" and Football (soccer) had passwords relating to the team they followed. The passwords were even blurted out in part when cheering for their team when it came to Football fans: a variant of 'Manu' was included in passwords for what we decided were hardcore Manchester United fans.


### Themes

We surveyed 100 people with a specific set of questions. 

The following summarises our findings:
